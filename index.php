            <p class="particle">... and particle wizard</p>

            <p class="about-text">My  name is Josh Whitkin. Iâ€™m a professional with more than 7 years of industry experience in 
                Games Design, Level design, Scripting and Visual Effects.  What makes me passionate about games 
                is the combination of technology  and creativity, and how multiple disciplines come together 
                to create an interactive experience. Whether I'm designing for puzzle games, 2D platformers or 
                3D environments. I always tell a story.</p>
